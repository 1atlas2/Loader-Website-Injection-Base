# Loader & Website Injection Base
This project was initiated a few weeks ago as a weekend project. It involves a website injection concept that incorporates a login system through client and website communication. The project is noticeably unfinished, as evident from the code. However, I won't be sharing the completed version of the project, which is why I am uploading the unfinished base on GitHub. I believe that such a concept has not been seen on this platform before.

# Showcase

# How does it work?
It's quite straightforward. Once you open the loader, it continuously scans the website for the link "https://siresware.xyz/testing/command.php" and checks the displayed text on the website. This is where the command list comes into play. For example, if the command "Dx0001" is displayed on the website, the loader sends a login request. The same process occurs on the website, facilitating communication between the website and the loader. I understand that it is not secure, which is why it serves as a Base.
