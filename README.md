# Loader & Website Injection Base
This project was a personal endeavor that I started a few weekends ago just for fun. It is still in an unfinished state and serves primarily as a foundation for teaching purposes, rather than being a fully polished product intended for the market. Nonetheless, it remains interesting because it involves a unique website injection process.

# Setup


# How does it work?
It's quite straightforward. Once you open the loader, it continuously scans the website for the link "https://siresware.xyz/testing/command.php" and checks the displayed text on the website. This is where the command list comes into play. For example, if the command "Dx0001" is displayed on the website, the loader sends a login request. The same process occurs on the website, facilitating communication between the website and the loader. I understand that it is not secure, which is why it serves as a Base.
